## DropStart - Kickstart My Drop (Drupal)

DropStart is a script and set of support files to download, install, configure and launch a working Drupal instance for testing and development pruposes. It leverages Drupal, install profiles, Drush, Drush Make, Drush qd (quick Drupal) and other tech to pull this off. In the end, a browser opens with a full Drupal instance. An "admin" user will already be logged in to the site.

Usage:
<code>
  $ dropstart.sh &lt;destination-folder&gt;
</code>
